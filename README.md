# STM32_BLUEPILL
Welcome to the repository for the STM32 Bluepill development board project, designed using Altium Designer. This project includes all necessary files for creating and working with the STM32 Bluepill, a popular development board featuring the STM32F103C8T6 microcontroller.

# Project Overview
The STM32 Bluepill is a compact, low-cost microcontroller board based on the STM32F103C8T6 chip, offering a range of features suitable for embedded development and prototyping. This repository contains Altium Designer files for designing and customizing your own Bluepill board, including schematics, PCB layouts, and component libraries.

# Features
Schematic Design: Detailed schematics of the STM32 Bluepill board, including connections for power, GPIOs, and peripherals.
PCB Layout: Complete PCB design files with routing for the STM32F103C8T6 microcontroller and associated components.
Component Libraries: Custom Altium libraries for all components used in the design.
Design Files: Altium Designer project files (.PrjPcb, .SchDoc, .PcbDoc) and output files for manufacturing.

# Clone the Repository:
